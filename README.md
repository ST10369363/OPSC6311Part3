The app is catered for the user to budget, in terms of how they track their expenses as well as minimum and maximum goals. Currently the app consists of the foillowing: Login page, where the user will be able to access their account by logging in
                          : Sign up page, where users arent registered on the app to register
                          : Profile/ Dashboard, where the users will be able to see their expenses, catagories, set minimum and maximum goals
                          : Camara feature where the user will be able to take pictures of their expenses 

Some of the innovative features we integrated based on documentation include bar graphs that help users visualize their overall budgeting goals. These elements not only make the data more accessible but also assist users in assessing whether they are on track financially.
Lastly, we added a progress bar to illustrate how close the user is to reaching their savings goals. This feature is designed to motivate users by providing a clear visual indicator of their progress, helping them stay committed to their financial objectives


# UPDATE

 2. Gamifiation has been added onto the system to encourage user retention as well as to maintain the users path to their savings goals
 3. Bugs that were on the previous version have been fixed
